## ðŸŒŸ Basic

### 1. Is JavaScript single-threaded?

Yes, JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it has a single call stack and executes code sequentially, one operation at a time. This can lead to blocking behavior if a task takes too long to execute.

### 2. Explain the main component of the JavaScript Engine and how it works.

The main components of the JavaScript engine are:

- **Call Stack:** Keeps track of the execution context.
- **Heap:** Allocates memory for objects.
- **Event Loop:** Manages asynchronous code execution.
- **Web APIs:** Browser-provided features (e.g., DOM, setTimeout).
  The engine executes synchronous code on the call stack, handles asynchronous tasks via the event loop, and uses the heap for memory management.

### 4. Difference between var, let, and const?

- **var:** Function-scoped, hoisted, can be re-declared and updated.
- **let:** Block-scoped, not hoisted, cannot be re-declared but can be updated.
- **const:** Block-scoped, not hoisted, cannot be re-declared or updated (but objects and arrays can be mutated).

### 5. Different data types in JavaScript?

- **Primitive Types:** String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt.
- **Non-Primitive Types:** Object (including Array, Function, etc.).

### 6. What is a callback function and callback hell?

- **Callback Function:** A function passed as an argument to another function and executed after some operation is completed.
- **Callback Hell:** A situation where multiple nested callbacks make code hard to read and maintain.

### 7. What is a Promise and Promise chaining?

- **Promise:** An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- **Promise Chaining:** Linking multiple promises to handle asynchronous operations in sequence, improving readability and maintainability.

### 8. What is async/await?

`async/await` is syntactic sugar over promises, allowing asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style. `async` functions return a promise, and `await` pauses the function execution until the promise settles.

### 9. What is the difference between == and === operators?

- `==`: Abstract equality operator, performs type coercion if types differ.
- `===`: Strict equality operator, no type coercion, checks both value and type.

### 10. Different ways to create an Object in JavaScript?

- Object literal: `const obj = {};`
- `new Object()`
- Object.create()
- Constructor function
- ES6 class

### 11. What is the rest and spread operator?

- **Rest Operator (`...`)**: Collects all remaining elements into an array.
  ```javascript
  function sum(...args) {
    return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  }
  ```
- **Spread Operator (`...`)**: Expands an iterable into individual elements.
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
  ```

### 12. What is a higher-order function?

A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function.

### 13. What are JavaScript Template Literals?

Template literals allow embedding expressions in strings, enclosed by backticks (`). They support multi-line strings and interpolation.

```javascript
const name = 'John';
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

### 14. Explain the difference between null and undefined.

- **null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **undefined**: Represents an uninitialized variable or a non-existent property.

### 15. What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?

An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined. It helps in creating a new scope and avoiding polluting the global scope.

```javascript
(function () {
  console.log('IIFE executed');
})();
```

### 16. What are the truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?

- **Falsy values**: `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`.
- **Truthy values**: All values other than falsy values are considered truthy.

### 17. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

- **Synchronous code**: Executes sequentially, blocking the execution of subsequent code until the current task is completed.
- **Asynchronous code**: Executes non-sequentially, allowing subsequent code to run while waiting for the completion of asynchronous tasks.

### 18. What is the purpose of the `typeof` operator?

The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand. For example:

```javascript
typeof 42; // "number"
typeof 'hello'; // "string"
typeof true; // "boolean"
typeof undefined; // "undefined"
typeof null; // "object"
typeof {}; // "object"
typeof function () {}; // "function"
```

### 19. What is destructuring in JavaScript?

Destructuring is a syntax that allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables:

```javascript
const [a, b] = [1, 2]; // a = 1, b = 2
const { name, age } = { name: 'Bob', age: 25 }; // name = 'Bob', age = 25
```

### 20. What are default parameters in JavaScript?

Default parameters allow function parameters to have default values if no value or undefined is passed:

```javascript
function greet(name = 'Guest') {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
greet(); // "Hello, Guest!"
greet('Alice'); // "Hello, Alice!"
```

### 21. What are array methods like map, filter, and reduce?

- `map`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const doubled = arr.map((x) => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
  ```
- `filter`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const evens = arr.filter((x) => x % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
  ```
- `reduce`: Executes a reducer function on each element, resulting in a single output value:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const sum = arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0); // 10
  ```

### 22. What is the spread operator and how is it used?

The spread operator (`...`) expands an iterable (like an array) into individual elements:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, c: 3 }; // {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

### 23. How do you handle errors in JavaScript?

Errors in JavaScript can be handled using `try...catch` blocks:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.error(error.message); // "Something went wrong"
} finally {
  // Code to execute regardless of the try/catch outcome
  console.log('Cleanup');
}
```

## ðŸ§© Intermediate

### 24. What is a Closure? What are the use cases of Closures?

A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. Use cases include:

- Data encapsulation
- Function factories
- Maintaining state in asynchronous functions

### 25. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope. Only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

### 26. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?

The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period between entering a block scope and the point where a variable declared with `let` or `const` is initialized. Accessing the variable in the TDZ results in a ReferenceError.

### 27. What is a prototype chain? What is the Object.create() method?

- **Prototype Chain:** A mechanism by which objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype object, forming a chain until it reaches `null`.
- **Object.create()**: Creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.
  ```javascript
  const proto = {
    greet: function () {
      return 'Hello';
    },
  };
  const obj = Object.create(proto);
  ```

### 28. What is the difference between Call, Apply, and Bind methods?

- **Call:** Invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.
  ```javascript
  func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2);
  ```
- **Apply:** Invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.
  ```javascript
  func.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2]);
  ```
- **Bind:** Creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
  ```javascript
  const boundFunc = func.bind(thisArg, arg1);
  ```

### 29. What are lambda or arrow functions?

Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing function expressions and do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### 30. What is a currying function?

A currying function in JavaScript is a function that takes multiple arguments one at a time, returning a new function for each argument, until all arguments have been provided. This technique transforms a function with multiple parameters into a series of functions that each take a single parameter.

```javascript
function log(level) {
  return function (message) {
    console.log(`[${level}] ${message}`);
  };
}

const info = log('INFO');
const warn = log('WARN');
const error = log('ERROR');

info('This is an informational message.'); // Outputs: [INFO] This is an informational message.
warn('This is a warning message.'); // Outputs: [WARN] This is a warning message.
error('This is an error message.'); // Outputs: [ERROR] This is an error message.
```

### 31. What are the features of ES6?

- Arrow Functions
- Classes
- Enhanced Object Literals
- Template Literals
- Destructuring Assignment
- Default Parameters
- Rest and Spread Operators
- Let and Const
- Iterators and Forâ€¦of Loop
- Promises
- Modules (import/export)
- Generators
- Map and Set
- WeakMap and WeakSet
- Symbol
- New Built-in Methods (e.g., Array methods, String methods)
- Block-Scoped Functions
- New Number Methods
- New Math Methods
- Reflect API
- Proxy API
- Tail Call Optimization

### 32. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies the top-level properties of an object, but nested objects are shared by both the original and the copy.

  ```javascript
  const shallowCopy = { ...original };
  ```

- **Deep Copy**: Copies all levels of the object, including nested objects, ensuring complete duplication.
  ```javascript
  const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
  ```

### 33. What is debouncing in JavaScript?

Debouncing ensures that a function is not called too frequently. It delays the execution of the function until after a specified wait time has elapsed since the last call.

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeout;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), wait);
  };
}
```

### 34. What is throttling in JavaScript?

Throttling ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified time period, regardless of how often it is triggered.

```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
  let inThrottle;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
    }
  };
}
```

### 35. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?

- **localStorage**: Data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- **sessionStorage**: Data persists only for the duration of the page session.

### 36. What is the difference between `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`?

- **Object.keys()**: Returns an array of the object's own property names.
- **Object.values()**: Returns an array of the object's own property values.
- **Object.entries()**: Returns an array of the object's own key-value pairs.

### 37. What is the difference between `map` and `forEach`?

- `map`: Returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element. It does not modify the original array.
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const doubled = arr.map((x) => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
  ```
- `forEach`: Executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not return a new array.
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.forEach((x) => console.log(x)); // 1 2 3
  ```

### 38. What is the purpose of `Object.assign()`?

`Object.assign()` copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object, and returns the target object:

```javascript
const target = { a: 1 };
const source = { b: 2, c: 3 };
const result = Object.assign(target, source); // {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

### 39. What is the difference between `slice` and `splice` methods?

- `slice`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object. Does not modify the original array.
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const sliced = arr.slice(1, 3); // [2, 3]
  ```
- `splice`: Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements. Modifies the original array.
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const spliced = arr.splice(1, 2); // [2, 3]
  console.log(arr); // [1, 4]
  ```

### 40. What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?

- **Function Declaration:** Defines a function with the specified parameters. It is hoisted, meaning it can be called before it is defined in the code.
  ```javascript
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```
- **Function Expression:** Defines a function inside an expression. It is not hoisted.
  ```javascript
  const add = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
  };
  ```

### 41. What is the `new` keyword in JavaScript?

The `new` keyword creates an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
const john = new Person('John', 30);
```

### 42. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?

- **Synchronous Code:** Executes sequentially, blocking the execution of subsequent code until the current task is completed.
- **Asynchronous Code:** Executes non-sequentially, allowing subsequent code to run while waiting for the completion of asynchronous tasks.

  ```javascript
  // Synchronous
  console.log('Start');
  console.log('End');

  // Asynchronous
  console.log('Start');
  setTimeout(() => console.log('Middle'), 1000);
  console.log('End');
  ```

### 43. What is an async function and how does it differ from regular functions?

An async function is a function that returns a promise. It allows asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need for explicit promise chains:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('url');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## ðŸš€ Expert

### 44. What is an execution context, execution stack, variable object, and scope chain?

- **Execution Context:** Environment where JavaScript code is executed. Contains the variable object, scope chain, and `this` value.
- **Execution Stack:** Also known as the call stack, it keeps track of the execution contexts.
- **Variable Object:** Contains function arguments, local variables, and function declarations.
- **Scope Chain:** Links scopes in nested functions, allowing access to variables from outer scopes.

### 45. What is the priority of execution of callback, promise, setTimeout, and process.nextTick()?

1. `process.nextTick()`
2. Microtasks (e.g., Promises)
3. Macrotasks (e.g., setTimeout, setInterval)
4. I/O callbacks

### 46. What is a factory function and generator function?

- **Factory Function:** A function that returns a new object.
  ```javascript
  function createPerson(name) {
    return { name };
  }
  ```
- **Generator Function:** A function that can pause execution and yield multiple values over time.
  ```javascript
  function* generator() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
  }
  ```

### 47. Different ways to clone (shallow and deep copy of object) an object?

- **Shallow Copy:**
  ```javascript
  const shallowCopy = { ...original };
  ```
- **Deep Copy:**
  ```javascript
  const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
  ```

### 48. How to make an object immutable? (seal and freeze methods)?

- **Object.seal()**: Prevents adding or removing properties but allows modifying existing properties.
  ```javascript
  Object.seal(obj);
  ```
- **Object.freeze()**: Prevents adding, removing, or modifying properties.
  ```javascript
  Object.freeze(obj);
  ```

### 49. What is an event and event flow, event bubbling, and event capturing?

- **Event:** An action or occurrence detected by the program.
- **Event Flow:** The order in which events are received and handled.
- **Event Bubbling:** Events propagate from the target element up to the root.
- **Event Capturing:** Events propagate from the root down to the target element.

### 50. What is event delegation?

Event delegation involves adding a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for multiple child elements, utilizing event bubbling for efficiency.

### 51. What are server-sent events?

Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow a server to push real-time updates to the client via a single HTTP connection.

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('url');
eventSource.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log(event.data);
};
```

### 52. What is a web worker or service worker in JavaScript?

- **Web Worker:** Runs JavaScript in the background

parallel to the main thread, allowing for concurrent execution without blocking the UI.

```javascript
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.postMessage('Hello');
worker.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log(event.data);
};
```

- **Service Worker:** Acts as a proxy between the web application and the network, enabling features like offline capabilities and push notifications.

### 53. How to compare 2 JSON objects in JavaScript?

```javascript
function deepEqual(obj1, obj2) {
  return JSON.stringify(obj1) === JSON.stringify(obj2);
}
```

### 54. What are the different types of scopes in JavaScript?

- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function or block.
- **Function Scope**: Variables declared within a function.
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` or `const` within a block (e.g., inside loops, if statements).

### 55. Explain the concept of "this" keyword in JavaScript.

The `this` keyword refers to the context in which a function is called. Its value can vary depending on how and where the function is invoked:

- In global scope or simple function calls, `this` refers to the global object.
- In methods, `this` refers to the object the method is called on.
- In event handlers, `this` refers to the element that received the event.
- With `call`, `apply`, or `bind`, `this` can be explicitly defined.

### 56. What are weak references in JavaScript?

Weak references are objects that do not prevent their referents from being reclaimed by garbage collection. `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are examples, allowing garbage collection if there are no other strong references to the objects.

`Using WeakMap in React`

Suppose youâ€™re building a modal component in React, and you want to associate some private data with the modal component itself, without preventing the modal from being garbage collected when itâ€™s no longer needed. You can use a WeakMap for this purpose. Here's how you might implement it:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

// Create a WeakMap to associate private data with modal components.
const modalData = new WeakMap();

function Modal({ isOpen, onClose, children }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isOpen) {
      // Associate private data with this instance of the modal component.
      modalData.set(Modal, { openTime: new Date() });
    } else {
      // The modal is closing, and it can be garbage collected along with its associated data.
      modalData.delete(Modal);
    }
  }, [isOpen]);

  return isOpen ? (
    <div className="modal">
      {children}
      <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
    </div>
  ) : null;
}

export default Modal;
```

`Using WeakSet in React`

If your component adds event listeners directly to the DOM (though this is less common in React due to its synthetic event system), you can use WeakSet to manage event listeners

```javascript
const listenerSet = new WeakSet();

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleClick = () => {
      // handle click event
    };

    document.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
    listenerSet.add(handleClick);

    return () => {
      // Clean up event listener when component unmounts
      document.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
      listenerSet.delete(handleClick);
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>Component content</div>;
}
```

### 57. What is memoization?

Memoization is an optimization technique that caches the results of function calls to avoid repeated calculations for the same inputs.

`Without memoization`

```javascript
function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}

sqaure(2); // returns 4
square(9999999999999999); // This is an expensive computation
square(9999999999999999); // Should we re-compute for same large input?
```

`With memoization`

```javascript
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

function memoizedSquare() {
  let cache = {};
  return function optimizedSquare(num) {
    if (num in cache) {
      console.log('Returning from cache');
      return cache[num];
    } else {
      console.log('Computing square');
      const result = square(num);
      cache[num] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
}

const memoSquare = memoizedSquare();
console.log(memoSquare(9999999999999999));
console.log(memoSquare(9999999999999999));

// Outputs:
// "Computing square"
// 1e+32

// "Returning from cache"
// 1e+32
```

### 58. Explain the concept of tail call optimization.

Tail call optimization is a feature where the last function call in a function can be optimized by the JavaScript engine to avoid creating a new stack frame, thus improving performance and preventing stack overflow in recursive functions.

This feature is however not shipped in all browsers. Currently only safari supports it in strict mode.

### 59. What are JavaScript Symbols and their use cases?

Symbols are a new primitive type introduced in ES6, used to create unique identifiers for object properties:

```javascript
const sym1 = Symbol('description');
const sym2 = Symbol('description');
console.log(sym1 === sym2); // false
```

Use cases:

- Creating unique property keys
- Implementing private properties and methods
- Defining well-known symbols (e.g., `Symbol.iterator` for iteration protocols)

### 60. How does JavaScript handle concurrency?

JavaScript handles concurrency using an event loop and callback queue, allowing asynchronous operations to be processed without blocking the main thread. This includes mechanisms like promises, async/await, and Web APIs like `setTimeout`.

### 61. What are WeakMap and WeakSet in JavaScript?

- **WeakMap:** A collection of key/value pairs where keys are objects and values can be arbitrary values. Keys are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage-collected if there are no other references to them.
  ```javascript
  const weakMap = new WeakMap();
  const obj = {};
  weakMap.set(obj, 'value');
  ```
- **WeakSet:** A collection of objects where each object is weakly referenced.
  ```javascript
  const weakSet = new WeakSet();
  const obj = {};
  weakSet.add(obj);
  ```

### 62. What is the Proxy object in JavaScript and how is it used?

A `Proxy` object allows you to create a custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g., property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation):

```javascript
const target = {};
const handler = {
  get: function (obj, prop) {
    return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 42;
  },
};
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
console.log(proxy.someProperty); // 42
```

### 63. How does the `Reflect` object work in JavaScript?

The `Reflect` object provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations, similar to those of `Proxy` handlers. It makes it easier to handle operations such as `get`, `set`, and `deleteProperty`:

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1 };
Reflect.set(obj, 'b', 2); // { a: 1, b: 2 }
console.log(Reflect.get(obj, 'b')); // 2
Reflect.deleteProperty(obj, 'a'); // true
console.log(obj); // { b: 2 }
```

### 64. What are Tagged Template Literals in JavaScript?

Tagged template literals allow you to parse template literals with a function:

```javascript
function tag(strings, ...values) {
  return strings[0] + values.map((v, i) => `${v}${strings[i + 1]}`).join('');
}
const name = 'Alice';
const age = 25;
const result = tag`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`; // "Name: Alice, Age: 25"
```

### 65. What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?

The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous callbacks in JavaScript. It processes the message queue and executes callback functions when the call stack is empty:

```javascript
console.log('Start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('Callback'), 0);
console.log('End');

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Callback
```

### 66. How does garbage collection work in JavaScript?

JavaScript uses automatic garbage collection with algorithms like mark-and-sweep to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable:

- **Mark-and-Sweep:** The garbage collector marks all objects, then removes the ones that are no longer reachable from the root (global object).

### 67. What are mixins in JavaScript?

Mixins are a way to add properties and methods from one object to another, allowing for the sharing of functionalities across different objects:

```javascript
const mixin = {
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello');
  },
};
const obj = {};
Object.assign(obj, mixin);
obj.greet(); // "Hello"
```
