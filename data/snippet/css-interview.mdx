## ðŸŒŸ Basic

### 1. What is CSS and why is it used?

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout and presentation of web pages.

### 2. How do you apply CSS to an HTML document?

- Through inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets.

### 3. What is the difference between class and ID selectors in CSS?

- Class selectors are reusable and prefixed with a period (`.`), while ID selectors are unique within a page and prefixed with a hash (`#`).

### 4. What is the purpose of the `box-sizing` property?

- It defines how the width and height of an element are calculated, either including or excluding padding and borders.

### 5. Explain the concept of the CSS Box Model.

- The Box Model consists of content, padding, border, and margin.

### 6. What are pseudo-classes in CSS?

- Pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`).

### 7. How do you center a block element horizontally?

- By setting `margin: 0 auto;` on the element and ensuring it has a defined width.

### 8. What are inline styles and how do you use them?

- Inline styles are CSS declarations written directly in the `style` attribute of an HTML element.

### 9. How do you add comments in CSS?

- Comments in CSS are added using `/* comment */`.

### 10. What are the different types of CSS selectors?

- Type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, and pseudo-element selectors.

### 11. What is the difference between `margin` and `padding`?

- `Margin` is the space outside an element's border, while `padding` is the space inside the border, around the content.

### 12. What is the `display` property and what are some of its values?

- The `display` property specifies the display behavior of an element. Common values include `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`, `flex`, and `grid`.

### 13. How do you link an external CSS file to an HTML document?

- Using the `<link>` element: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`.

### 14. What is a CSS reset and why is it used?

- A CSS reset is used to remove default browser styling, ensuring consistency across different browsers.

### 15. What is the difference between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none`?

- `visibility: hidden` hides the element but it still takes up space in the layout. `display: none` removes the element from the layout completely.

### 16. What is a CSS selector?

- A pattern used to select the elements you want to style.

### 17. How do you set the background color of an element?

- Using the `background-color` property: `background-color: #ffffff;`.

### 18. What does the `:nth-child(n)` selector do?

- It selects the nth child of its parent. The value of `n` can be a number, a keyword (like `odd` or `even`), or a formula.

### 19. What is the use of the `!important` declaration in CSS?

- It overrides any other styles, including inline styles, to apply the specified style.

### 20. How do you make a list horizontal?

- By setting the `display` property of the list items to `inline` or using Flexbox.

### 21. What is the difference between `block` and `inline` elements?

- `Block` elements take up the full width available and start on a new line, whereas `inline` elements take up only as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.

### 22. How do you style an element with multiple classes in CSS?

## ðŸ§© Intermediate

### 23. What are CSS preprocessors and name a few commonly used ones?

- CSS preprocessors extend CSS with variables, nested rules, and functions. Common examples include Sass, Less, and Stylus.

### 24. Explain the difference between `absolute`, `relative`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning.

- `relative`: Positioned relative to its normal position.
- `absolute`: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
- `fixed`: Positioned relative to the viewport.
- `sticky`: Toggles between `relative` and `fixed` based on the scroll position.

### 25. What is the `z-index` property and how does it work?

- `z-index` controls the stacking order of elements. Higher values are placed in front of lower values.

### 26. What are CSS Grid and Flexbox? Compare them.

- CSS Grid is a layout system for creating two-dimensional grid-based layouts, whereas Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system. Grid is better for complex layouts, while Flexbox is optimal for simpler and single-direction layouts.

### 27. How can you create a responsive web design using CSS?

- By using media queries, flexible grid layouts, and responsive units like percentages, `vw`, and `vh`.

### 28. What are CSS animations and transitions? ### Describe the `@keyframes` rule and how it is used in CSS animations.

- Transitions allow changes in CSS property values to occur smoothly over a specified duration, while animations allow more complex and keyframe-based state changes.

- The `@keyframes` rule defines the keyframes for an animation. It specifies the style changes at various points in the animation sequence. Example:
  ```css
  @keyframes slide {
    from {
      transform: translateX(0);
    }
    to {
      transform: translateX(100px);
    }
  }
  ```

### 29. What is the `float` property used for, and what are its possible values?

- The `float` property is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, with possible values `left`, `right`, `none`, and `inherit`.

### 30. Explain the concept of CSS Sprites and their benefits.

- CSS Sprites combine multiple images into a single image file to reduce the number of HTTP requests and improve page load performance.

### 31. What are pseudo-elements in CSS and provide examples?

- Pseudo-elements are used to style specified parts of an element, such as `::before`, `::after`, `::first-letter`, and `::first-line`.

### 32. How do you create a responsive image gallery using CSS Grid?

- By defining a grid container with responsive column and row definitions, and using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

### 33. What are media queries and how do they work?

- Media queries are used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as width, height, and orientation. Syntax: `@media (max-width: 600px) { /* styles */ }`.

### 34. What is the `flex` property in Flexbox and how do you use it?

- The `flex` property is a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`, used to define the flexible item's ability to grow, shrink, and the initial size.

### 35. What are CSS transitions and how do you create them?

- CSS transitions allow you to change property values smoothly over a given duration. Example:
  ```css
  .box {
    transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
  }
  .box:hover {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  ```

### 36. What are the differences between `inline-block` and `inline` elements?

- `inline-block` elements are like `inline` elements but allow setting width and height.

### 37. How do you create a CSS triangle?

- By using the `border` property on an element with zero width and height. Example:
  ```css
  .triangle {
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border-left: 50px solid transparent;
    border-right: 50px solid transparent;
    border-bottom: 100px solid red;
  }
  ```

### 38. Explain the CSS `clip-path` property.

- The `clip-path` property allows you to clip an element to a basic shape or to an SVG source.

### 39. What is the `object-fit` property and when would you use it?

- The `object-fit` property specifies how an `<img>` or `<video>` should be resized to fit its container. Common values are `fill`, `contain`, `cover`, `none`, and `scale-down`.

### 40. What are CSS functions like `calc()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()`, and how do they work?

- These CSS functions perform dynamic calculations and allow for more responsive and adaptable layouts.
  - `calc()`: Calculates values, e.g., `width: calc(100% - 50px);`.
  - `min()`: Takes the minimum value, e.g., `width: min(100%, 600px);`.
  - `max()`: Takes the maximum value, e.g., `width: max(300px, 50%);`.
  - `clamp()`: Constrains a value between an upper and lower limit, e.g., `font-size: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 2rem);`.

### 41. How do you use the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements?

- These pseudo-elements are used to insert content before or after an element's content. Example:
  ```css
  .element::before {
    content: 'Prefix';
  }
  .element::after {
    content: 'Suffix';
  }
  ```

### 42. What is the `filter` property in CSS?

- The `filter` property applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element. Example: `filter: blur(5px);`.

### 43. Explain the concept of specificity and how it affects CSS rules.

- Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules match the same element. It is calculated based on the number of type selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.

### 44. Describe the concept of CSS Variables and how they are used.

- CSS Variables (or Custom Properties) allow you to store values in a reusable manner using the `--variable-name` syntax. They are defined within a scope and accessed using the `var()` function.

### 45. Explain the concept of a CSS Grid template and its key properties.

- A CSS Grid template defines the structure of a grid container, using properties like `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-areas`, and `grid-gap`.

### 46. Explain the concept of responsive typography and how you achieve it in CSS.

- Responsive typography ensures that font sizes adapt to different screen sizes. This can be achieved using relative units like `em` or `rem`, or viewport-based units like `vw` and `vh`.

## ðŸš€ Expert

### 47. What is the `contain` property in CSS and how is it used?

- The `contain` property allows you to limit the scope of the browser's styling, layout, and paint work to a specific element and its contents.

### 48. How do you optimize CSS for better performance?

- By minimizing CSS, reducing the number of HTTP requests, using shorthand properties, and avoiding complex selectors.

### 49. What are CSS Modules and how do they help in styling?

- CSS Modules are a CSS file in which all class and animation names are scoped locally by default. They help avoid global scope issues and improve maintainability.

### 50. How can you create a custom CSS grid framework?

- By defining a flexible grid container using CSS Grid or Flexbox properties and creating reusable classes for rows, columns, and breakpoints.

### 51. How do you create complex layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox together?

- By using CSS Grid to define the overall layout structure and Flexbox to manage the internal layout of individual grid items.

### 52. What are CSS Houdini APIs and why are they important?

- CSS Houdini APIs are a set of low-level APIs that allow developers to extend CSS by creating their own custom styles and layouts. They provide greater control over the rendering process.

### 53. What is the `will-change` property and how does it improve performance?

- The `will-change` property informs the browser about which properties are expected to change, allowing it to optimize rendering in advance. Example: `will-change: transform;`.

### 54. What are CSS Subgrid and how does it work?

- Subgrid allows grid items to inherit and share the parent gridâ€™s definitions. It enables consistent alignment within nested grid structures.

### 55. How do you create a custom scrollbar using CSS?

- By styling the pseudo-elements `::-webkit-scrollbar`, `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb`, etc.:
  ```css
  ::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 12px;
  }
  ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background: #888;
    border-radius: 6px;
  }
  ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
    background: #555;
  }
  ```
