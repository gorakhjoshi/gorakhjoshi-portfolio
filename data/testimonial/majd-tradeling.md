I’ve worked with Segun at Tradeling to establish a foundation for the product design system. Segun is an outstanding design engineer partner, his design background played a crucial role in developing a framework that serve internal / external users and help the product to scale.

He champions accessibility, challenge rational, use cases, and push the boundaries
to ensure a better outcome. What we’ve achieved at such small scale of a team wouldn’t
be feasible without his support and guidance.

I hope we will cross path in the future, and get the opportunity to work with him again.
