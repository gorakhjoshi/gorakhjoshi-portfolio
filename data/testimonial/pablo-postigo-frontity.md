Segun is one of the most talented and passionate engineers I've had the chance to work with. During his time at Frontity he has been proactive and not afraid of new challenges.

He acts like an owner, takes responsibility for his actions, always looks for excellence. He has the capacity to deliver world-class products and his great communication skills, both spoken and written, make him a great team member.
