I took some time to reflect on my past experiences and looked through my journal. I was inspired by a note I wrote to myself in 2019. It was a classic thought from [Jim Rohn](https://www.jimrohn.com/) about how to approach learning and life.

- Be a student not a follower. Don't be a sheep, following everything you hear other people say.
- Examine everything you hear, watch, see or read. Give careful thought to things and learn make your own decisions.
- Don't outsource thinking and decision making to outside influences, it only makes you weak over time.
- When you make a decision and it winds up wrong, the lessons you learn from that failure would make you equipped to make a better decision next time.

This is true for engineering, career and life.
