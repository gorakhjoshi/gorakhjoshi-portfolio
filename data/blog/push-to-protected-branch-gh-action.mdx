While working to improve the CI workflows in Chakra UI, we wanted to create a Github action that updates the changelog anytime we release a new version. The github action looked like:

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

We noticed that this action step kept failing because you can't push to a protected branch (we had protected the `main` branch to prevent unwanted mistakes).

It turns out that, with the default setup used in `actions/checkout@v2`, you can't `git push` from your GitHub actions if the repository has branch protection turned on.

After a few hours of research, here's how I resolved it:

- Ensure you have admin-level repo permissions
- Create a personal access token (PAT) with "repo" permissions. <br/> Go to **"Settings"** > **"Developer Settings"** > **"Personal access tokens"**
- Confirm that administrators are not included in branch protection rules
- Use that PAT in the `actions/checkout@v2`step

The new workflow looks like this

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
```

and viola! We can now push to the protected main repo via Github actions.
